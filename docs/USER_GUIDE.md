## Getting Started

### What is Universal Request Analyzer?

Universal Request Analyzer is a powerful browser extension that helps you understand, analyze, and optimize your web application's network performance. It captures detailed information about every network request your browser makes and provides comprehensive analytics to help you identify bottlenecks and improve performance.

### Installation

1. **Chrome/Edge:**
   - Visit the Chrome Web Store
   - Search for "Universal Request Analyzer"
   - Click "Add to Chrome/Edge"
   - The extension icon will appear in your toolbar

2. **Firefox:**
   - Visit Firefox Add-ons
   - Search for "Universal Request Analyzer"
   - Click "Add to Firefox"

3. **Manual Installation (Developers):**
   - Clone the repository
   - Run `npm install` and `npm run build`
   - Load unpacked extension from the `dist` folder

### First-Time Setup

When you first install the extension:
1. Click the extension icon to open the popup
2. Review the default settings (request capture is enabled by default)
3. Performance metrics are **disabled by default** to minimize overhead
4. Configure your preferences in the options page if needed

## Understanding the Extension

### Three Ways to View Data

The extension provides three interfaces, each optimized for different use cases:

1. **Popup** - Quick insights for the current domain
2. **DevTools Panel** - Detailed analysis with real-time updates
3. **Dashboard** - Comprehensive cross-domain analytics

### Data Architecture

The extension uses a medallion architecture with three data layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw, immutable request data
- **Silver Layer**: Validated and enriched data with star schema
- **Gold Layer**: Pre-aggregated analytics and insights

This architecture ensures data integrity while enabling powerful analytics.

## Using the Popup Interface

### Opening the Popup

Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

### What You See

The popup automatically shows metrics for **the current domain** you're viewing:

- **Total Requests**: Number of requests made by this domain
- **Average Response Time**: Mean response time across all requests
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Data Transferred**: Total bytes transferred

### Request Type Filter

Use the dropdown to filter by resource type:
- **All Requests** - Show all captured requests
- **XHR/API** - AJAX and API calls
- **Fetch** - Fetch API requests
- **Scripts** - JavaScript files

## Configuration & Settings

### Accessing Settings

Right-click extension icon → Options, or click "Settings" in any interface.

### General Settings

#### Request Capture
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle request monitoring on/off
- **Default**: Enabled
- **Impact**: When disabled, no new requests are captured

#### Data Retention
- **Duration**: 1 day, 7 days (default), 14 days, 30 days
- **Purpose**: Controls how long historical data is kept
- **Recommendation**: 7 days for most users, 30 days for long-term analysis

#### Maximum Stored Requests
- **Range**: 100 - 100,000 requests
- **Default**: 10,000
- **Impact**: Older requests are removed when limit is reached (FIFO)

### Performance Monitoring Settings

Performance metrics provide detailed timing breakdown but add overhead.

#### Enable Performance Metrics
- **Default**: Disabled
- **When to Enable**: When you need detailed timing analysis
- **Impact**: Slight performance overhead (~2-5%)

#### Sampling Rate
- **Range**: 1% - 100%
- **Default**: 100% (when enabled)

## Understanding Metrics

### Basic Metrics

#### Total Requests
Count of all network requests in the selected time range and filters.

#### Average Response Time
Mean duration from request start to completion.

**Good**: < 200ms
**Acceptable**: 200-500ms
**Slow**: > 500ms

#### Error Rate
Percentage of requests that failed (4xx, 5xx, or network errors).

**Good**: < 1%
**Acceptable**: 1-5%
**Poor**: > 5%

#### Data Transferred
Total bytes of data sent and received.

**Consideration**: Higher is not always worse if requests are necessary and efficient.

### Performance Metrics

#### DNS Lookup Time
Time to resolve domain name to IP address.

**Typical**: 20-120ms
**Optimization**: Use DNS prefetching, CDN with good DNS

#### TCP Connection Time
Time to establish TCP connection.

**Typical**: 50-200ms
**Optimization**: Keep-alive connections, HTTP/2

#### SSL/TLS Handshake Time
Time for HTTPS negotiation.

**Typical**: 50-300ms
**Optimization**: Session resumption, TLS 1.3

#### Time to First Byte (TTFB)
Time from request sent to first response byte received.

**Good**: < 200ms
**Acceptable**: 200-500ms
**Poor**: > 500ms

**Factors**: Server processing time, network latency

#### Download Time
Time to download response body.

**Depends on**: Response size, bandwidth
**Optimization**: Compression, smaller responses

#### Total Duration
Complete request time (sum of all phases).

### Core Web Vitals

When performance monitoring is enabled, the extension tracks Core Web Vitals:

#### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
Time until largest content element is rendered.

**Target**: < 2.5s
**Acceptable**: 2.5-4.0s
**Poor**: > 4.0s

#### First Input Delay (FID)
Time from user interaction to browser response.

**Target**: < 100ms
**Acceptable**: 100-300ms
**Poor**: > 300ms

#### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
Visual stability - sum of unexpected layout shifts.

**Target**: < 0.1
**Acceptable**: 0.1-0.25
**Poor**: > 0.25

### Percentiles

#### P50 (Median)
50% of requests are faster than this value.

**Use**: Understanding typical experience

#### P95
95% of requests are faster than this value.

**Use**: Understanding almost all users' experience

#### P99
99% of requests are faster than this value.

**Use**: Identifying worst-case scenarios

**Why Percentiles Matter**: Averages can hide problems. P95 and P99 show outliers that affect real users.

## Advanced Features

### Filter Hierarchy

Understanding how filters work together:

```
Domain → Page → Request Type → Status → Time Range
```

Each level narrows down the dataset:
1. Start with domain (or all domains)
2. Optionally select specific page(s)
3. Filter by request type if needed
4. Filter by status code if needed
5. Choose time range

### OHLC Performance Analysis

Inspired by financial candlestick charts, OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) shows:

- **Open**: First request response time in period
- **High**: Slowest request in period
- **Low**: Fastest request in period
- **Close**: Last request response time in period
- **Volume**: Number of requests in period

**Use Cases:**
- Spot performance variations
- Identify patterns (e.g., slower at peak times)
- Compare time periods
- Track optimization impact

### Third-Party Domain Tracking

The extension automatically categorizes third-party domains:

**Categories:**
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.
- **Advertising**: Google Ads, DoubleClick, etc.
- **CDN**: Cloudflare, Akamai, etc.
- **Social**: Facebook, Twitter widgets, etc.
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, etc.

**Why It Matters:**
- Third-party requests affect your page performance
- Identify which services add most overhead
- Optimize or remove heavy third-party dependencies

### Security Features

#### Mixed Content Detection
Identifies HTTP resources loaded on HTTPS pages.

**Risk**: Security warnings, blocked resources
**Action**: Update to HTTPS

#### Risk Level Assessment
Domains are assigned risk levels based on:
- Third-party status
- Known malicious patterns
- SSL/TLS status
- Response patterns

## Tips & Best Practices

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

**Possible Causes:**
1. Request capture is disabled
   - **Solution**: Enable in settings
2. No requests match current filters
   - **Solution**: Broaden filters (e.g., select "All Domains")
3. Data retention period expired
   - **Solution**: Increase retention period in settings

### Performance Metrics Not Available

**Cause**: Performance monitoring is disabled by default.

**Solution**: 
1. Open Options → Performance Settings
2. Enable "Capture Performance Metrics"
3. Choose sampling rate
4. Reload pages to start capturing metrics

### Extension Using Too Much Memory

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce maximum stored requests (Settings → General)
2. Decrease data retention period
3. Disable performance metrics if not needed
4. Export and clear old data periodically

### Charts Not Rendering

**Possible Causes:**
1. No data in selected time range
2. All requests filtered out
3. Browser compatibility issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check filters and time range
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check browser console for errors

### Slow Dashboard Loading

**Causes:**
- Large dataset
- Complex filters
- Multiple visualizations

**Solutions:**
1. Narrow time range
2. Apply domain filters
3. Reduce data retention period
4. Export and archive old data

### Data Not Persisting

**Cause**: Browser storage issues or extension updated.
