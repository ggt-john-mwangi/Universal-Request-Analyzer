## Key Insights from Analysis 💡

### Why URA Has Low Adoption

1. **Too Complex** - Advanced features (star schema, OHLC) overwhelm casual users
2. **Unclear Value** - Doesn't clearly explain who it's for and why
3. **Missing Basics** - Lacks features users expect (filter chips, body viewer)
4. **Poor Discovery** - Chrome Web Store listing not optimized
5. **High Barrier** - Takes 5-10 minutes to see value (should be <1 minute)

### What Makes URA Special

- ✅ **Historical Data** - Only extension with true data persistence
- ✅ **Advanced Analytics** - Star schema, OHLC, multi-timeframe (unique)
- ✅ **Time Travel** - Historical trends and regression detection
- ✅ **Cross-Domain** - Analyze all domains together
- ✅ **Professional Grade** - Medallion architecture, dimensional analytics

### The Strategy

**Two-Tier Approach:**

1. **Simple Mode** (Default)

   - Target: Casual developers (80% of market)
   - Show: Basic filtering, current page only, simple charts
   - Hide: Star schema, OHLC, advanced analytics

2. **Advanced Mode** (Opt-in)
   - Target: Performance engineers (20% of market)
   - Show: All current features
   - Unlock: Professional-grade analytics

**Value Proposition:**

> "Never lose your network debugging data again. It's DevTools, but your data doesn't disappear when you close the tab."
