## Why Use Universal Request Analyzer?

**The Problem:** Chrome DevTools is great for real-time debugging, but your data disappears when you close the tab. You can't track performance over time, compare different sessions, or analyze historical patterns.

**The Solution:** Universal Request Analyzer gives you:
- 🕐 **Persistent Data** - Your request data survives tab/browser closes
- 📊 **Historical Analytics** - Track performance trends over days and weeks
- 🔍 **Advanced Search** - Find any request across all your browsing history
- 📈 **Performance Insights** - Identify slow APIs and third-party services
- 💾 **Export Anywhere** - HAR, JSON, CSV formats for sharing and analysis

### Perfect For:
- 🐛 Debugging intermittent API issues that are hard to reproduce
- ⚡ Performance optimization and regression detection
- 🔍 Analyzing third-party service impact on your site
- 📋 Sharing network evidence for bug reports
- 📊 Tracking API performance over time

## Features

- **Unified Filtering System**: Hierarchical filtering by domain → page → request type across all interfaces
- **Time Travel**: View historical performance data and trends over time
- **Real-time Analytics**: Capture and analyze network requests in real-time
- **Detailed Performance Metrics**: Track DNS, TCP, SSL, TTFB, and download times
- **Rich Visualizations**: Interactive charts and graphs for request data
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Works on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- **Export Capabilities**: Export filtered data for further analysis
- **Configurable Monitoring**: Flexible filter options and retention settings

## Unified Filtering

The extension provides consistent filtering across three interfaces:

### Popup
- **Auto-filtered by current domain**: Automatically shows metrics for the current tab's domain
- **Request type filter**: Filter by XHR/API, Fetch, Scripts, Stylesheets, Images, Fonts, Documents
- **Aggregated metrics**: Shows combined statistics across all pages within the domain
- **Quick insights**: View total requests, average response time, errors, and data transferred

### DevTools Panel
- **Domain filter**: Select current domain, all domains, or specific tracked domains
- **Page filter**: Choose specific pages or view aggregated data for the domain
- **Request type filter**: Filter by resource type
- **Time range selection**: View data from last 5 minutes to last 30 days
- **Time Travel**: Access historical data with hourly, daily, or minute-by-minute grouping
- **Multiple tabs**: Overview, Requests Table, Performance, Endpoints, and Errors
- **Real-time updates**: Auto-refresh every 5 seconds with instant filter application

### Dashboard
- **All domains**: View metrics across all tracked domains
- **Domain → Page hierarchy**: Select domain first, then choose specific pages
- **Request type filtering**: Filter by resource type
- **Time range selection**: Analyze data over different time periods
- **Comprehensive charts**: Volume timeline, status distribution, performance trends

## Time Travel Feature

Navigate through historical performance data:

1. Click the "History" button in the DevTools Panel
2. Select grouping: Hourly, Daily, or By Minute
3. View historical trends for:
   - Request volume over time
   - Average response times
   - Error rates and patterns
   - Performance regressions

## Performance Metrics

The extension captures detailed performance monitoring:

- DNS lookup time
- TCP connection time
- SSL/TLS handshake time
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Download time
- Total request duration
- P95, P99 percentiles

*Note: Performance metrics are disabled by default to minimize performance impact. Enable them in extension settings when needed.*

### Performance Monitoring Configuration

- Enable/disable performance monitoring
- Adjust sampling rate (default: 100%)
- Configure metric retention period (default: 7 days)
- Choose specific metrics to capture:
  - Navigation Timing
  - Resource Timing
  - Server Timing
  - Custom Metrics

4. Click "Analytics" to open the DevTools Panel or "Dashboard" for full view

### DevTools Panel
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Navigate to the "Request Analyzer" tab
3. Use filters to narrow down requests:
   - **Domain**: Select which domain to analyze
   - **Page**: Choose specific page or view all pages aggregated
   - **Time Range**: Select how far back to look (5 min to 30 days)
   - **Request Type**: Filter by resource type
   - **Status**: Filter by HTTP status codes
4. Switch between tabs for different views:
   - **Overview**: Real-time charts and key metrics
   - **Requests Table**: Detailed request information with sorting
   - **Performance**: Timing breakdowns and slow request analysis
   - **Endpoints**: API endpoint performance analysis
   - **Errors**: Failed requests categorization
5. Click "History" to access time-travel feature

### Dashboard
1. Open the extension options/settings page
2. Navigate to the Dashboard tab
3. Select domain and optionally a specific page
4. Choose time range and request type filters
5. View comprehensive performance analytics

## Filter Hierarchy

```
Popup:     [Auto: Current Domain] → [All Pages Aggregated] → [Request Type]
Panel:     [Domain] → [Page] → [Request Type] → [Status] → [Time Range]
Dashboard: [Domain] → [Page] → [Request Type] → [Time Range]
```

**Aggregation behavior:**
- When no specific page is selected: Shows aggregated metrics across all pages in the domain
- When a page is selected: Shows metrics only for that specific page
