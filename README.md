## Overview

**Universal Request Analyzer** is a powerful browser extension designed to capture, store, and analyze network request timings across all major browsers. It helps developers monitor API performance, track request details, log performance metrics, and visualize data efficiently.

## Features
- **SQLite Database Storage**: Persistently store all captured requests for long-term analysis
- **Continuous Background Capture**: Automatically capture requests as you browse across all pages
- **Comprehensive Configuration**: Customize what and how data is captured
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter requests by domain, status, type, URL, and date range
- **Data Visualization**: View charts and plots of request performance metrics
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export data as JSON, CSV, SQLite, or PDF
- **Detailed Timing Information**: Analyze DNS, TCP, SSL, TTFB, and download times
- **Domain and Route Analysis**: Track performance by domain and route
### Core Functionality

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other major browsers.
- **Continuous Background Capture**: Automatically logs network requests across all visited pages.
- **Detailed Timing Information**: Captures network performance metrics, including DNS lookup, TCP connection, SSL handshake, Time to First Byte (TTFB), and download duration.
- **Domain-Specific Analysis**: Track performance by domain and individual request routes.

### Data Storage & Management

- **SQLite Database Storage**: Stores captured requests persistently for long-term analysis.
- **Excel File Logging**: Each domain has its own Excel file for organized data storage, with new data appended to existing rows when requests match previous entries.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter captured requests by domain, status, type, URL, and date range.
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export request data in JSON, CSV, SQLite, or PDF format.

### Visualization & Reporting

- **Data Visualization**: Generate charts and plots for request performance metrics.
- **Request Headers & Body Analysis**: Capture request headers and payloads for deeper inspection.
- **Configurable UI**: Customize capture settings, filters, auto-export, and visualization preferences.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggt-john-mwangi/Universal-Request-Analyzer.git
   ```
2. **Load the Extension**:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder.
   - The extension should now be installed and active.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Click the extension icon in the browser toolbar to open the popup.
2. Browse websites as usual; the extension captures network requests automatically.
3. Open **Developer Tools (DevTools)** (`F12`) and navigate to the "Universal Request Analyzer" panel.
4. Analyze captured requests, including timing breakdowns and performance metrics.

### Configuration

1. Open the extension popup and click the **Config** button.
2. Adjust capture settings, filtering options, and export preferences.
3. Save the configuration for future browsing sessions.

### Exporting Data

1. Click the **Export** button in the popup.
2. Select the desired export format (JSON, CSV, SQLite, PDF).
3. Optionally enter a filename.
4. Click "Export" to download the data.

### Filtering Requests

1. Click the **Filter** button in the popup.
2. Define filters based on status, type, domain, URL, and date range.
3. Apply filters to refine the captured request list.

## Architecture

The extension consists of the following key components:

1. **Background Script**: Captures network requests and manages the SQLite database.
2. **Content Script**: Extracts performance metrics using the Performance API.
3. **Popup UI**: Provides an interface for viewing and analyzing captured requests.
4. **Options Page**: Allows users to configure the extensionâ€™s behavior.

## Database Schema

The extension utilizes an SQLite database to store captured request data efficiently.
